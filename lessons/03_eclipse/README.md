# Lesson 03: Hello World Example Revisited

We now repeat the `Hello World!` example, but as Eclipse project.

Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org) is one of the most popular integrated developer environments for Java. It provides a lot of tools, may of which we will use in this lecture.

## 1. Why using Eclipse?

It offers:

- syntax highlighting
- refactoring
- compilation of code while you type it
- auto-completion
- debugger
- several other tools that we will use, such as
    * Maven
    * git
    * JUnit
    
## 2. Installing Eclipse

- go to http://www.eclipse.org
- click "Download"
- select Eclipse package (currently *Eclipse Neon* and "Download 64 bit" (if you have a 64 bit machine, that is)
- download the package
- unpack it into a folder of your liking
- inside that folder, you can find an executable named `eclipse` or `eclipse.exe`: run it

## 3. Using Eclipse

We again use a [Hello World!](../02_java) program as example, but this time it comes as Eclipse project.
