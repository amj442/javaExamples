# Lesson 4: Types, Variables, and Assignments

In this lesson, we learn about the different primitive types supported by Java (and the non-primitive type String).

## 1. Variable Declaration and Assignment

We learn how to declare variables and how to assign them.


## 2. Basic Type Compatibility

We learn that some types are losslessly compatible. We can, for instance, assign an integer (`int`) value into a `long` variable and it will be stored right nively.

We can also store an `int` into a `double` without losing anything. However, there are some `long` values which will be rounded if we try to store them in a `double` .
